        <h3>About Me</h3>I stumbled upon coding by pure luck - all because I
        love a good challenge! <br /> I found my way into this world by
        following my love for problem-solving and a (not very) healthy dose of
        curiosity. There's just something about tackling complex problems and
        making things work that keeps me hooked. <br /> I've always been
        fascinated by the beauty of mathematics and the logic that regulates
        every aspect of our lives. Coding was the perfect way to combine all
        these things.
        <br />
        Also I love cats (who doesn't?) and space but I think you guessed that
        already.
